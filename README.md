# Flake's No Russian
A WordPress plugin for those who hate Russian translit in slugs and urls. "Remember, no Russian."

[“Powered by Yandex.Translate”](http://translate.yandex.com/)

cyr2lat is nice and saves the day, but but it doesn't  fix the fact that Russian translit sucks.

This plugin translates slugs instead of transliterating so your (and your client's) address bar will never ever show some ugly stuff like
"obzor-chastnyh-predprinimatelej-zanimayushhihsya-razrabotkoj". Ugh!

## Requirements: Yandex Translate API
You'll have to get a FREE Yandex Translate  API key [there](https://tech.yandex.com/keys/get/?service=trnsl) and paste it under WP admin options Tools -> Flake's No Russian.

## Installation
Not yet on official WordPress Plugin Directory. Install via ftp or .zip upload.
